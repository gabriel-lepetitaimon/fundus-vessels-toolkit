    Skeletonize a binary image of retinal vessels using the medial axis transform.
    Junctions and endpoints are detected and labeled, and simple cleanup operations are performed on the skeleton.

    Args:
        vessel_map (H, W): Binary image of retinal vessels.
        return_distance: If True, also return the distance transform of the medial axis.
        fix_hollow: If True, fill hollow cross pattern.
        max_spurs_length: Remove small end branches whose size is inferior to this. 1px branches should be removed as
                           they will be ignored in the graph construction.
        branches_label: If provided store the branches label in this array.
        skeletonize_method: Method to use for skeletonization. (One of: 'medial_axis', 'zhang', 'lee'. Default: 'lee'.)
    Returns:
        The skeletonized image where each pixel is described by an integer value as:
            - 0: background
            - 1: Vessel endpoint
